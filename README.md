# StructureAndEvolutionOfStars

The goal of this project was to perform several star evolution simulations. Using the \texttt{MESA} package, I have simulated the time evolution of the central abundances for multiple massive stars. A Hertzsprung-Russel diagram has been simulated using 6 different mass stars. The evolution of the central temperature against the density plane has been simulated and a Kippenhahn diagram has been created of two different mass stars. 

All is visible in `Stellar Evolution and structure MESA.ipynb`
